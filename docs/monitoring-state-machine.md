# Monitoring state machine

## Overview

This document defines how endpoint state is calculated from raw monitoring results.

It is the authoritative source for:

- endpoint state values  
- state transition rules  
- threshold behaviour  
- dependency suppression rules  
- agent-offline handling  
- alert-trigger conditions  
- recovery-trigger conditions  

This document is intentionally explicit. Monitoring state must be deterministic, explainable, and auditable.

---

## Design principles

- Raw results are facts  
- State is derived by the server  
- Agents do not calculate endpoint state  
- Agents do not apply dependency suppression  
- Suppression is a first-class state  
- State transitions must be deterministic  
- Alerting must be based on confirmed state transitions  
- Missing data must not be silently treated as healthy  
- Agent health and endpoint health must be tracked separately  

---

## Core concepts

### Raw check result

A raw check result is a single factual observation submitted by an agent.

Examples:

- ICMP ping succeeded in 3 ms  
- ICMP ping timed out  

A raw check result is not itself an incident or a state.

---

### Endpoint state

Endpoint state is the server’s interpretation of an endpoint’s status for a given agent assignment.

State is derived from:

- raw results  
- thresholds  
- dependency relationships  
- agent health context  

---

### Alert state

Alert state is derived from endpoint state transitions.

---

### Agent health state

Agent health describes whether the agent itself is online.

Agent health is separate from endpoint state.

---

## State model

State is tracked **per assignment (agent + endpoint)**.

### Endpoint states

- `UNKNOWN`
- `UP`
- `DEGRADED`
- `DOWN`
- `SUPPRESSED`

---

## State definitions

### `UNKNOWN`

Insufficient trusted data to determine state.

Typical causes:
- no results yet  
- agent offline  
- startup  

---

### `UP`

Endpoint is reachable and meets all success criteria.

---

### `DEGRADED`

Endpoint is reachable, but quality is below acceptable thresholds.

Examples:
- high latency  
- packet loss  
- intermittent instability  

Important:

- endpoint is still reachable  
- this is not a failure state  
- this does not imply outage  

### v1 behaviour

- `DEGRADED` is defined but **not actively used unless explicitly implemented**
- endpoints will not enter `DEGRADED` without degradation rules configured

---

### `DOWN`

Endpoint is considered failed based on failure threshold.

---

### `SUPPRESSED`

Endpoint is failing, but failure is attributed to a dependency.

Important:

- this is a real state  
- alerts are suppressed  
- endpoint may still be unreachable  

---

## Assignment-scoped state

State must be calculated per:

- agent  
- endpoint  

Different agents may observe different states.

---

## Threshold semantics

### Failure threshold

Number of consecutive failures required before `DOWN`.

### Recovery threshold

Number of consecutive successes required before `UP`.

### Counter behaviour

- success resets failure count  
- failure resets success count  

---

## Initial state behaviour

Initial state is:

- `UNKNOWN`

Transitions:

- success → toward `UP`
- failure → toward `DOWN` or `SUPPRESSED`

---

## Transition rules

### Allowed transitions

- `UNKNOWN → UP`
- `UNKNOWN → DOWN`
- `UNKNOWN → SUPPRESSED`
- `UNKNOWN → DEGRADED` (future use)

- `UP → DOWN`
- `UP → SUPPRESSED`
- `UP → DEGRADED`

- `DEGRADED → UP`
- `DEGRADED → DOWN`
- `DEGRADED → SUPPRESSED`

- `DOWN → UP`
- `DOWN → SUPPRESSED`
- `DOWN → DEGRADED` (future use)

- `SUPPRESSED → UP`
- `SUPPRESSED → DOWN`
- `SUPPRESSED → DEGRADED` (future use)

---

## Transition logic (v1)

### Core evaluation order

1. assignment enabled  
2. agent health valid  
3. update counters  
4. evaluate thresholds  
5. evaluate dependency  
6. determine state  

---

### Pseudologic

```text
if assignment disabled:
    state = UNKNOWN

else if agent not trustworthy:
    state = UNKNOWN

else:
    failureReached = consecutiveFailure >= failureThreshold
    recoveryReached = consecutiveSuccess >= recoveryThreshold
    directParentDown = any(direct parent state == DOWN in same agent scope)

    if recoveryReached:
        state = UP

    else if failureReached and directParentDown:
        state = SUPPRESSED

    else if failureReached:
        state = DOWN

    else:
        state = current state
```

---

## Dependency model

### Rule (v1)

- an endpoint may have zero, one, or many direct parent dependencies
- endpoint is eligible for `SUPPRESSED` only when:
  - failure threshold is reached, and
  - at least one direct parent is currently `DOWN` in the same agent scope
- only direct parents in `DOWN` cause suppression
- direct parents in `SUPPRESSED` do **not** cascade suppression
- suppression is derived by the server only (never by the agent)

---

## Alerting rules

### Alerts open on:

- `→ DOWN`

### Alerts suppressed on:

- `SUPPRESSED`

### Recovery alerts:

- `DOWN → UP`

### v1 degraded behaviour

- `DEGRADED` does NOT trigger alerts by default  

---

## Agent health interaction

Agent offline must NOT imply endpoint failure.

### Behaviour:

- stale agent → endpoints remain temporarily  
- prolonged outage → endpoints become `UNKNOWN`

---

## Missing data rules

- missing data ≠ success  
- missing data ≠ failure  

Default:

- `UNKNOWN`

---

## Disabled assignments

Disabled endpoints:

- not monitored  
- state becomes `UNKNOWN`  
- do not alert  
- do not suppress others  

---

## Reevaluation triggers

State must be recalculated when:

- new result arrives  
- dependency changes  
- agent health changes  
- assignment changes  

---

## Example scenarios

### Normal outage

- fail ×3 → `DOWN`
- success ×2 → `UP`

---

### Dependency suppression

- switch `DOWN`
- printer fails → `SUPPRESSED`
- switch recovers → printer reevaluated

---

### Agent offline

- agent stops reporting  
- endpoints → eventually `UNKNOWN`  

---

## Invariants

- agents never submit state  
- suppression is server-only  
- `SUPPRESSED` never alerts  
- `DOWN` always respects threshold  
- agent offline ≠ endpoint down  
- system must be deterministic  

---

## Future extension (DEGRADED)

Planned future logic may include:

- latency thresholds  
- packet loss thresholds  
- rolling averages  
- percentile-based degradation  

Degraded must remain:

- non-failure  
- policy-driven  
- optionally alertable  

---

## Summary

**Agents submit facts. The server derives state.**

- `UP` = healthy  
- `DEGRADED` = reachable but poor quality  
- `DOWN` = confirmed failure  
- `SUPPRESSED` = dependency-caused failure  
- `UNKNOWN` = insufficient data  

The system must remain predictable, auditable, and explainable at all times.

---

## v1 uptime interpretation note (read model)

- Operational uptime summaries use assignment-scoped state history over a rolling 24-hour window.
- Time in `UP` and `DEGRADED` is counted as up-time.
- Time in `DOWN`, `SUPPRESSED`, and `UNKNOWN` is not counted as up-time.
- This note defines read-side reporting semantics only; it does not change transition rules above.
